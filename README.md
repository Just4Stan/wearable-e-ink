# Wearable-E-Ink
A beginner-friendly soldering workshop project to build a WiFi-enabled, programmable e-paper name badge. This project is designed to be completed in a 2-3 hour session, teaching participants how to solder both through-hole and surface-mount (SMD) components.

Initial designed to give workshops at HighTechLab in Leuven
